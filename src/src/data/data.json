    "description": "Imagine that you were planning to move to another house closer to a new working place, but the budget was not enough for you to fully cover the price of the new house. So you applied for a loan for a bank to secure more budget for buying a house. <p> But after a while, you were notified from an AI-based screening process in the bank that, you were being rejected from getting a loan. It was embarrassing to you because you were not able to move forward to prepare other stuff to buy a house. You still had enough time until buying a house and several chances to get a loan, but you felt this is an important step to figure out how you could be prepared to buy a house with the help of a loan. <p> You didn’t know what your status led to the rejection, and what to do to get approved next time, so you decided to ask about the decision to the company via chat. In response, a human consultant agent provided an explanation. The following are a table of attributes and values used in AI-assisted decision-making, and a set of explanations generated by a human consultant.",
