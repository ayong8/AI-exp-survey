    "description": "Imagine that you were planning to move to another house closer to a new working place, but the budget was not enough for you to fully cover the price of the new house. So you applied for a loan for a bank to secure more budget for buying a house. <p> But after a while, you were notified from an AI-based screening process in the bank that, you were being rejected from getting a loan. It was embarrassing to you because you were not able to move forward to prepare other stuff to buy a house. You still had enough time until buying a house and several chances to get a loan, but you felt this is an important step to figure out how you could be prepared to buy a house with the help of a loan. <p> You didn’t know what your status led to the rejection, and what to do to get approved next time, so you decided to ask about the decision to the company via chat. In response, a human consultant agent provided an explanation. The following are a table of attributes and values used in AI-assisted decision-making, and a set of explanations generated by a human consultant.",

You decided to watch a movie on an online movie streaming service and got into the website. <p>When looking at the main page, it listed three recommended items as “you might like” on the top, all of which were Drama movies. But you didn’t like Drama movies more than other genres like Sci-fi or Action ones at this time. You could simply try other movies based on your choices, and have plenty of time to browse other movies to watch. <p>Then you found there was an interface for asking for AI-based explanations right next to the list of recommended items, so you clicked it to see how the system provides you automated explanations on those recommendations.
